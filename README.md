## IDEMPOTENCY

    Idempotency is when repeated operations produce the same result. For example, multiplying by 1 is an idempotent operation. No matter how many times you multiply a number by 1, the result is the same.

## COMMUTATIVITY
    Commutativity occurs when different operations produce the same result no matter the order in which they are applied. Addition and multiplication are all commutative operations.

## Operational Transformation (OT)
    OT is an algorithm that compares concurrent operations and detects if they will cause the documents to not converge. If the answer is yes, the operations are modified (or transformed) before being applied
    
## Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)
    CRDTs operate by converting each character in the document into a unique object with specific properties.
